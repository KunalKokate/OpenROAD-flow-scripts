# Designs ran on ASAP7 PDK Platform - Test 1
### AIM: 
To improve the timing parameters below by making changes in CTS script:
1.	Overall Performance Elapsed Runtime
2.	CPU User Time
3.	CTS Elapsed Seconds to run CTS Stage
All the parameters to look are highlighted in bold.
#### Description: 
This document reflects the default performance runtimes of current designs without any changes made. I plan to improve the overall runtime for a design by modifying the Clock Tree Synthesis TCL script. 
I have documented my changes in another document (Test2 of all the designs.docx) to compare the run times for all the designs.
